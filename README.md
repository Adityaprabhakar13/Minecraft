# MINECRAFT SURVIVAL
Minecraft is a creative game that enhance your CREATIVITY SKILLS.
There are 3 modes int it - Survival, Creative and Adventure
Survival - In this mode you have to gather resources like food, ores from mines to get armour, weapons and tools. You need to make a house (a.k.a your base) and a Bed to skip night. There will be Mobs like (spawn in dark) zombies, villager-zombies, creepers, skeletons, Spiders and mobs like (spawn at random) Pillagers, Vindicators, Witches and mobs like (spawn at particular place) Slimes, Evoker, Vex, etc. which are dangerous but there are passive, semi - dangerous mobs. There are two bosses - Wither and Ender Dragon. You will win the game after defeating them.
Creative - In this mode no mob will attack you. You have unlimited blocks of any type, You can create different structures from that and do some Redstone Contraption (a.k.a Mechanics)
Adventure - Similar to survival, But no need to worry about Food. This mpde is basically for Add-on maps or mods.
